    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows Http is the underlying concept of Web. The base concept is a request is initiated by a browser or web-client and you get a response back. Some day&#8217;s back I noticed some interesting slides from Alessandro Nadalin&#8217;s talk (Mixing the history of HTTP, SPDY and HTTP/2.0)[http://odino.org/mixing-the-history-of-http-spdy-and-http-slash-2-dot-0/]</p>

<p>It really inspired me to look more into the Http. I also understood a fact that I was missing many basic stuffs. I thought of playing with it.</p>

<p>Note : This is just experimental stuffs which I tried to learn looking at various sources. Things can be wrong also, feel free to correct if you think so.</p>

<p>Normally you don&#8217;t care about the underlying http headers. There are status codes which are passed before an actual content is send. So the browser knows the state whether the content is available in server, what content-type is coming, for eg like html, json, xml etc. The content-length, accept-language, etc. You can see a list of http request and response headers at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields.</p>

<p>So we are going to create the headers other than the normal apache header. By default the status is 200 OK.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">header(&#39;Content-Type: text/html&#39;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">echo &#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you notice the broswer headers you can see something like</p>

<p>Http Caching:</p>

<p>So you may not have seen any benefict in the above for its what you normally get. Now lets enter to the world of http caching.</p>

<p>You may have heard about Expires, Cache-Control, Last-Modified, Etag headers. Yes with the help of these we can make use of http caching. Let&#8217;s see a base example.</p>

<p>What will happen when you request the same url? It reloads the page. So the base concept is same, the client requests to server and server responds. But the scenario changes, if the browser is asking with some additional headers like If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match.</p>

<p>If the response from server has set Last-Modified header value, then the request initiated by broswer will be having If-Modified-Since header.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">header(&#39;Content-Type: text/html&#39;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">header(&#39;Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Jan 2011 12:00 GMT&#39;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">echo &#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now if you look into the Request Headers, you can notice the If-Modified-Since is send.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>Accept:text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Charset:ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate,sdch
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.8
</span><span class='line'>Cache-Control:max-age=0
</span><span class='line'>Connection:keep-alive
</span><span class='line'>Host:localhost:8000
</span><span class='line'>If-Modified-Since:Tue, 15 Jan 2011 12:00
</span><span class='line'>User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/11.10 Chromium/18.0.1025.168 Chrome/18.0.1025.168 Safari/535.19
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But we weren&#8217;t validating the data to make use of caching. What we need to do is check whether the server variable HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE is set. If its set, we need to validate whether its being modified. If both are same we just need to send a 304 status code which means not modified with out any content. I am hard coding for demonstration purpose.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">if ( isset($_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE&#39;]) &amp;&amp; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE&#39;] == &#39;Tue, 15 Jan 2011 12:00 GMT&#39; ) {</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    http_response_code(304);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">} else {</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    header(&#39;Content-Type: text/html&#39;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    header(&#39;Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Jan 2011 12:00 GMT&#39;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    echo &#39;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#39;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So in this case if you reload the page, it will send a 304 not modified header. Getting the 304 header browser knows its not modified. This is too fast and we save a huge band width and server processing. Isn&#8217;t it too good? I recall his slides 21 years of http which still not used very nicely :-/</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s move on to E-tag. As you have noticed the problem with Last-Modified and Expires is it uses GMT time. If the server and the client are not sync, then its hard. Thus the E-tag is introduced. You can create a md5 hash and set the E-tag header.</p>

<p>If you are setting a E-tag, then you can use the server variable HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH to validate it and send a status of 304.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So today @Paul M Jones officially declared the first stable release for Aura PHP components. Yes, I am really excited to see this release for it comes with a ton of great improvements for many components, bug fixes and sadly some BC breaks also. The list of packages which became stable are https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Autoload https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Http https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Marshal https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router : Yes I want to update the post at phpmaster.com for it has some breaks. I will be doing it in coming days. https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Signal https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Sql https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Uri : uri manipulation and there are some packages that are releasing the first Beta. Though these packages have been there for sometime, this is officially declared now only. Yes a bit delay from our part to declare it. https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Filter Filter is an awesome component for Sanitizing and Validating. You guys should look into the core to learn how it works really. Its an awesome piece of work! . I will in the coming days write something about it. https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Intl for Internationalization https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Session : for session handling Thanks to all to make the release happen. You can read the official declaration at http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/2976 . Join our mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp or #auraphp at irc.freenode.net .</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/node-224/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-24T21:22:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/node-224</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have read my earlier posts, you know I started to love templating library like Twig, Mustache etc. So I was interested to in-corporate Twig or PhlyMustache or any sort of templating library to auraphp. <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web/tree/develop">Aura.Web</a> makes it easy to do without much hassle. What you want to do is create the class which extends the Aura\Web\Renderer\AbstractRenderer and have a exec() method. For more details checkout <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web/tree/develop#data-and-rendering">Data and Rendering</a> {syntaxhighlighter class=&#8221;php&#8221;} Twig in <a href="http://github.com/harikt/Hari.Extras">Hari.Extras</a> . I will be adding support for PhlyMustache in the coming days. Hari.Extras comes with unit tests. Running unit tests : To run tests you should first install the dependencies. You can run {syntaxhighlighter class=&#8221;php&#8221;}composer.phar install &#8211;dev{/syntaxhighlighter} This will install the dependencies like Aura.Web, Aura.Framework, Twig, vfsstream etc in vendor folder. Now you can run the phpunit from tests folder. A big Thanks to @Paul M Jones and Chris Hartjes and all who have supported one way or the other giving me tips and tricks, motivation to make this happen. The nice thing is with composer for I don&#8217;t need to keep everything in the tests folder. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek">Seldaek</a> By the way as <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> is getting closer and closer for the next release I am planning to start a series of posts to get started with using the components. Stay tuned :) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/node-223</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paul M Jones wrote earlier <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/2487">When Possible, Use File *Resources* Instead Of File *Names*</a> and in comments <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard">Chris Hartjes</a> was mentioning about <a href="http://vfs.bovigo.org/">vfsStream</a>. So for <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">@auraphp</a> we thought of making to support vfsStream. What the hell it is? vfsStream is a PHP stream wrapper for a virtual file system that may be helpful in unit tests to mock the real file system. It can be used with any unit test framework, like PHPUnit or SimpleTest. So without touching the file system and not bothering too much about the operating system, file permissions, disk quota, removing the files created by tests on tear down etc we can make use of vfsstream. Lets start Go and get it via composer.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">{ </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    &quot;require&quot;: { </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">        &quot;mikey179/vfsStream&quot;: &quot;1.1.0&quot; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">        } </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    } </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> Run your composer.phar update.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">require &#39;vendor/autoload.php&#39;; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">use org\\bovigo\\vfs\\vfsStream; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">use org\\bovigo\\vfs\\visitor\\vfsStreamStructureVisitor; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">use org\\bovigo\\vfs\\visitor\\vfsStreamPrintVisitor; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$structure = array( &#39;Core&#39; =\&gt; array( &#39;AbstractFactory&#39; =\&gt; array( &#39;test.php&#39; =\&gt; &#39;some text content&#39;, &#39;other.php&#39; =\&gt; &#39;Some more text content&#39;, &#39;Invalid.csv&#39; =\&gt; &#39;Something else&#39;, ), &#39;AnEmptyFolder&#39; =\&gt; array(), &#39;badlocation.php&#39; =\&gt; &#39;some bad content&#39;, ) ); </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$root = vfsStream::setup(&quot;root&quot;, &#39;&#39;, $structure); </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> So now we have created a complex structured file system. How can we check whether the structure is same?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">vfsStream::inspect(new vfsStreamPrintVisitor()); </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> Now you have the structure how can you get the contents of the file you have created?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">file\_get\_contents(vfsStream::url(&#39;root/Core/badlocation.php&#39;)); </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> Or you can do via</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">$root-&gt;getChild(&#39;Core/badlocation.php&#39;)-\&gt;getContent(); </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> The question was raised by myself at https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/issues/48 . You can create directory and use vfsStreamPrintVisitor to see how the structure will be</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">mkdir(vfsStream::url(&#39;root/Core/AnEmptyFolder/hello&#39;)); vfsStream::inspect(new vfsStreamPrintVisitor()); </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p> There is more documentation how you can use in phpunit or have a look into the recent commits on <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/commit/f39e3452116072a3fe7f529584acb862a76fe15e">Aura.View</a> For more documentation have a look into https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/wiki</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>May be the question is so simple for you. But many times I feel it much complicated. Everyone would have started their website with a custom cms and later moved to Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or something similar. I used to look for a better book in any language which has design decisions made for the cms to make it such a way that it can be extended. Some of the books that seems interesting to me are 1 ) <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430218791">Pro Zend Framework CMS</a> 2 ) <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-2nd-edition/book">PHP 5 CMS Framework Development</a> It will be great to see if you have came across such books or do you recommend any other books. I am not just looking for PHP, but I am interested to read any sort of books, which will help me to build the next blogger. Waiting to hear you suggestions on the same.</p>

In the 12th Barcamp I talked about Aura , and it was a bit technical , so Kenny was making sure, not to go for intensive code. So the talk will not be limited to composer. I will be giving you an introduction to Eath , and also a small project which I have done for my personal use fbsearch. The tool is used to search your own status messages you have posted some months back. Its still on alpha for I didn&#8217;t get enough time to move on to make it much more better. It has some issues which I am already aware of. So if you are interested , be there :) .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working with different open-source projects for a while. Most of them utilizes phpdocumentator2 . I liked it for a while. But I have been looking at apigen, swami etc. Recently I started to make use of apigen extensively. What made me comfortable with apigen than phpdocumentator ? Certain times we may want to look into the code also to see the implementation . I am not sure may be there is an option in phpdocumentator that it can show the code when we click on a function / method. The code highlighting and is shown once we click on it. I like this feature the most. If you haven&#8217;t yet checked how the apigen generated api looks have a look into the one for the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project</a> which is at <a href="http://harikt.github.com/api">http://harikt.github.com/api</a> More information on a href=&#8221;http://apigen.org>apigen.org</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am really excited and at the same time a bit nervous, that I will be giving a workshop on <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for PHP</a> at <a href="http://www.osidays.com/">osidays</a>, which will be held at NIMHANS convention center Bangalore on 12-14 th of October 2012. I have received only the confirmation call, but not any mail as of now. If you have never heard of osidays, its one of the Asia&#8217;s largest open-source conference held. The workshop will be for around 3 Hours. I will be walking you through different components of aura and finally to show how you can use the individual libraries as a framework. If you have never heard about the aura project, its an independent library which can be dropped at any codebase. You can find the source code and more information of the project at <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a> . I know 3 Hours of continuous speech is a huge challenge. I will try my level best to make the workshop interesting. I will be also discussing with <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a> how I can make it more informative. In-order to attend the workshop I feel you need to grab the platinum pass. Looking forward meeting you guys at osidays :) .</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/09/15/contributor-to-aura-project/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-15T21:16:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/09/15/contributor-to-aura-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started my career with PHP I have been hearing about PEAR and Symfony a lot. <a href="http://joseantony.com/">Jose Antony</a> was the person who introduced the names <a href="http://symfony-project.org">Symfony</a>, <a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a>, <a href="http://propelorm.org">Propel</a> etc. But at work I never got a chance to touch on those. But my thirst to learn and explore moved me from Cochin to Bangalore and different websites. I played with Symfony in my free time ( Jobeet ). symfony-project was having good articles and videos to move with. I was working for a client who was interested in <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> and asked me to go for a try. It was a hard time in 2009 for me that, the documentation was poor ( from a point of me ) and there wasn&#8217;t a proper structure for people doing Zend Framework before the introduction of ZF tool in 1.8 ( I guess ) . The way it works and I wasn&#8217;t either familiar with irc or how I can get some help. Yes it was mainly not the Zend Framework or the community issues. It was my problems to understand from where I can get help. There wasn&#8217;t a good source to ask how I can use irc or get more information other than search internet. I really struggled with Zend Framework. Google was the only help which can find blog posts on errors and implementation. Some will work, some will not. I still remember the autoload error thrown which mentioned about this will be deprecated in Zend Framework 2 ( IIRC ). lol I wasn&#8217;t either able to understand looking at those errors. I was having a thought that frameworks cannot be developed by people like me :) . Why I thought so was I was hearing about design patterns a lot and I never properly understood what the hell it was. I failed to find a good mentor. I wrote some blog posts on <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">zend framework</a> to help people who start with it. I wasn&#8217;t either sure whether I was doing the right things. When I published the post, I did submitted a small intro to <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> with a note to verify whether I was doing it right. But the editor was busy that he mentioned its not possible to check. But some how it was published in <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> . I looked for the person who submitted the article and found it was <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt</a>. I never know about him earlier, but later understood he was the person behind <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> itself :) . In the mean time I did made some changes to the brief information at <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> and submitted it. The article brought lots of visitors and my 1 GB bandwidth got exceed for the 1st time in my life. My friend <a href="http://prajizworld.com">Prajith</a> who was in charge of the server quickly increased the limit when he got my call. This article brought me some opportunity to work with <a href="http://packtpub.com">Packt publishers</a>. Around 2009 or 2010 I came to know about a project called <a href="http://lithify.me">lithium</a> via a podcast. I was interested to learn how the frameworks are build. It was using the awesome PHP 5.3 , so I thought of looking into it. At osidays <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcoallier">David Coallier</a> gave an awesome talk on PHP 5.3 . I was able to meet <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org">Fabien Potencier</a> and get an autograph signed. I did meet some awesome PHP gurus at osidays. I started to look more closely into lithium which was in development. I wasn&#8217;t able to help for I was not that much strong on the concepts. They were using their own git server hosted at <a href="http://dev.lithify.me">dev.lithify.me</a> . I was not comfortable with <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>, but when we search for git related help, it will be from <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> docs. So I asked about switching the lithium to github for the leaders were having their own reasons to host it there. As I told I was starting with git, I pushed to master in my fork which I wasn&#8217;t either sure how I can send Pull Request . Again not the problem with the leaders. <a href="https://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/gwoo">Gwoo</a> etc helped me a lot when I got stuck with cloning the repo and errors. I learned some of the git commands, PHP 5.3 etc. I tried to help with testing the mysql stuffs which was done by <a href="https://github.com/Howard3">Howard</a>. Though I tried to contribute stuffs it didn&#8217;t happened for I failed to understand the process completely. I also looked closely <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a>, but was a bit hard for me. In the early 2011 I got introduced to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for php</a> via the blog post of <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a>. I have earlier looked <a href="http://solarphp.com">SolarPHP</a> , so he was a familiar face. I started to play with it. I also understood the design principles were clearly <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp">mailed in the group</a>, so I found the real mentor whom I was searching. IIRC I forked the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com">auraphp.github.com</a> and made some changes to the style from that of <a href="http://friendsofsymfony.github.com">friendsofsymfony.github.com</a> , and probably that was my first commit to an opensource project . I started to talk on irc and give some patches and bug reports and slowly I became a member of the organization <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> . I know my earlier commits were not going on the right way( I mean the git workflow ), but Paul did merged than closing it or gave suggestions what to do and why you should not go that way etc. He do gave credits for the bugs or suggestions we share in group. Yes it was real joy for people when your commits to an open-source is merged and when you get credits for the work you do. I have noticed people who do just close the PR for there was some error the way the PR is given or if its not the way its expected. I encourage leaders to at-least correct the mistakes than closing the PR with another commit which is already waiting for merge. People who come to open-source are interested to share and learn, not just download the code and use what you are building. They loved to hear why you choose the particular design pattern than blindly using with it, at-least me love it. Note : There is no hatred to any of the projects or leaders. Every one has tried to help me learn various stuffs. It was my failures, to understand it. I fear sometimes the way we think to express may not be read between words. That is the main reason I have kept this note. I know I have not covered everyone and many of the stuffs have been missed. But its not intentionally . But I would like to Thank all for the various helps you have provided via irc, twitter, facebook, mails etc. I did had a great time learning new stuffs. Thanks once again, lets share and learn.</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/09/10/thoughts-on-installing-zend-frameowork-via-composer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Note : First I thought of creating an issue, and it was not in github. These are not serious issues, but just my thoughts when installing ZF2 via composer. I am not sure whether its composer related or the way the zf2 is packaged to do it via composer. Normally the composer.json will be something like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &#8220;require&#8221;: { &#8220;zendframework/zend-form&#8221;: &#8220;2.0&#8221; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies - Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 25%\<sup>C</sup> hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ \<sup>C</sup> {/syntaxhighlighter} But you can see the composer tries to install the whole zend-framework. The problem is you need to add some more lines for its hosted in packages.framework.com and not in packagist.org . So your composer.json will be as below . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &#8220;repositories&#8221;: [ { &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;composer&#8221;, &#8220;url&#8221;: &#8220;http://packages.zendframework.com/&#8221; } ], &#8220;require&#8221;: { &#8220;zendframework/zend-form&#8221;: &#8220;2.0&#8221; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar install Loading composer repositories with package information Installing dependencies - Installing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% zendframework/zend-form suggests installing zendframework/zendservice-recaptcha (ZendService\ReCaptcha component) Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} Great you installed the zf2 form component. Now you can see where the form is installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ Annotation FieldsetInterface.php composer.json Fieldset.php Element FieldsetPrepareAwareInterface.php ElementInterface.php FormFactoryAwareInterface.php Element.php FormInterface.php ElementPrepareAwareInterface.php Form.php Exception TODO.md Factory.php View {/syntaxhighlighter} Assume you have more zf2 packages which you have added. At a later point you think of installing the framework as a whole itself than adding more packages in the composer.json . So your composer.json will be some what like {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &#8220;repositories&#8221;: [ { &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;composer&#8221;, &#8220;url&#8221;: &#8220;http://packages.zendframework.com/&#8221; } ], &#8220;require&#8221;: { &#8220;zendframework/zendframework&#8221;: &#8220;2.0&#8221; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ php ../composer.phar update Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies - Removing zendframework/zend-form (2.0.0) - Installing zendframework/zendframework (2.0.0) Downloading: 100% Writing lock file Generating autoload files {/syntaxhighlighter} The form has been removed and framework is installed. Lets have a look where its installed . {syntaxhighlighter class} hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/ autoload.php composer zendframework hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/ zend-form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ cat composer.json { &#8220;repositories&#8221;: [ { &#8220;type&#8221;: &#8220;composer&#8221;, &#8220;url&#8221;: &#8220;http://packages.zendframework.com/&#8221; } ], &#8220;require&#8221;: { &#8220;zendframework/zendframework&#8221;: &#8220;2.0&#8221; } } hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/ Form hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/ bin INSTALL.md README-DEV.md resources composer.json library README-GIT.md tests demos LICENSE.txt README.md vendor hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/ Zend hari@local:/var/www/composer/zf2$ ls vendor/zendframework/zend-form/Zend/Form/library/Zend/ Authentication Di InputFilter Mvc Stdlib Barcode Dom Json Navigation Tag Cache Escaper Ldap Paginator Text Captcha EventManager Loader Permissions Uri Code Feed Log ProgressBar Validator Config File Mail Serializer Version Console Filter Math Server View Crypt Form Memory ServiceManager XmlRpc Db Http Mime Session Debug I18n ModuleManager Soap {/syntaxhighlighter} You can notice its going on the wrong place. vendor/zendframework/zend-form . I am not sure whether every one needs to remove all the installed packages to install the framework . It seems possible with naming zendframework/package . Thus it don&#8217;t remove the installed packages. May be there are some other issues related to it for the naming of zendframework/zend-form like that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I got a chance to be at Bangalore for Open Hack India 2012 conducted by Yahoo.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrowan/7751044880/" title="IMG_5052 by mrowan, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8286/7751044880_e0cb1fea0b.jpg" alt="IMG_5052" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrowan/7751030446/" title="IMG_5065 by mrowan, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8296/7751030446_54abd3bc44.jpg" alt="IMG_5065" /></a>  It was really a great time to learn and do some of the experiments on Yahoo developer network (ydn) tools.  So we ended up trying to do some stuff with <a href="http://open.dapper.net/">dapper</a>. Dapper is a tool used for scrapping. It seems interesting from the workshop. But when I started using it, I was not successful. The dapper stopped responding / showing updating preview and stuffs.  What I was trying todo?&lt; /p>  I used to buy books comparing prices from isbn.net.in . It helped me a lot in buying books very cheap in India. But isbn.net.in was not having a feature called search for book title, and isbn details and as it does currently. Yes there were various other services that do the same. But if you think so then you must think why gmail was developed for there were yahoo mail, aol, msn etc were there.  So anyway learning was the idea, but as dapper fails to respond, it seems hard. I tried to contact the developers via the contact form. But I didn&#8217;t got a reply on Hack days to further proceed on it. So I tried various other methods via Yahoo pipes, yql etc.  It was really nice to learn and make my hands dirty with yql. I tried different stuffs. Exploring it I found the url shortner from Yahoo.  So once I reached home I made a url shortner which is currently in github ( http://harikt.github.com/openhackindia/ ) . Its simple with a few lines.  {syntaxhighlighter class=&#8221;html&#8221;} {/syntaxhighlighter} YQL is powerful, try and play. Its awesome guys.  I also came to know about Boomerang from Yahoo.  I was planning to buy a Bean Bag, and yes I got as a present from Yahoo.  Thank you guys for the awesome event. I am really sad for not able to submit a Hack :( . But I will explore more the ydn resoucres in future. Hope to see you next time if everything permits.

    <link href="http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/07/30/day2-at-thefifthelephant/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-30T23:17:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/07/30/day2-at-thefifthelephant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I reached so early that <a href="http://www.acodersdream.com/2012/07/walking-through-nimhans.html">I walked through the NIMHANS compound.</a>   The first talk was   1 ) Your GNOME on the cloud: Big data challenges in Personalized Medicine by Ramesh Hariharan :   My interest to medical field is too less that I am here into the field of IT. So I didn&#8217;t concentrate that much to the talk. I understood they are facing more problems than in Big data itself.     2 ) Building Watson : A breif overview of DeepQA and the Jeopardy! Challenge by Karthik Visweswariah :   The talk was some of the challenges facing in the terms used in search like &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;saw&#8221; and much more than that. The talk was interesting to know about the problems faced. Some of the audience expressed the talk was too good that it dived into the problems they really face in search. They also mentioned some people who search for malayalam words in english is too hard to understand what they are really searching.   We have some time for tea and networking. Discussed with friends whom I met in Hacknight in which room they are going etc.   3 ) Exponential Growth Models and Impact on Sales Forecast, Data Volume, Query Latency, Capacity, Planning and Search Latency by Ashok Banerjee   He started with the slide Fungus on White Bread. The talk was so interesting that he mentioned lots of stuffs that can impact on business. As he was from flipkart he has some real world examples also. He mentioned how the growth of certain products like books can go up where as certain products like under wear or tissue which can be used to wipe, when your eyes are wet will not. He also mentioned how it can bring new customers from the friends circle. Lately I came to know more about Ashok Banerjee from Mohith that he previously  worked with google and twitter. I feel this is the most interesting talk of the day.     4 ) The Elephant that flew: Big data analytics @ Inmobi by Gaurav Agarwal :   Though I loved to sit for the Aadhaar - worlds largest biometric identity platform I went to hear the talk The Elephant that flew. It was mainly for I came to know that in the mobile world there are none other than them. Guarav went through the challenges, the tools they used and the current tools they are using to build it for their customers. He showed a demo on Yoda which can be released open-source, but still they are thinking on how they should open-source it. Its mainly like whether they want to release as small components or as a whole itself.  What is Yoda ? Yoda is nothing but something similar to Hive or Pig. But Yoda according to them is more powerful and flexible. It takes less time to process.   5 ) Messaging architecture at Facebook by Joydeep Sen Sharma :    The talk went something deep into the architecture at facebook. As he was having limited time he was running too fast. The stuffs were somewhat deep, the truth is I wasn&#8217;t able to understand some of them. According to my friends the talk was interesting as they were delaing / facing it.     6 ) Real time intelligent systems and Big data streams by Deepinder Dhingra :    I didn&#8217;t find the talk that much interesting, probably for I am not really into the field.   7 ) Recommendation Play at flipkart by Gaurav Bhalotia, Pavan Srinivas, Renuka Khandewal :   The subject was so interesting. But they presented not in that interesting way. I felt they were not prepared well also. As the talk was for only 30 minutes when you have 3 speakers, there is hardly 10 minutes of time a speaker needs to talk. But even that they didn&#8217;t prepared is a bad thing. Probably they were nervous for may be their first talk? Anyway I feel they can improve, but these are just my thoughts on it.   After tea I skipped the 2 talks and we were talking with wikipedia foundation, the internet archive guys and open data people. The internet archive has a new project called openlibrary.org which has a collection of books. They also have an API which I want/love to explore. We also discussed how they scan old books and how google used to scan books. They mentioned google was using distructive scanning which means they will cut the side where the books are tied and is then run by the system itself. It was nice to learn how these guys scan these much books. I came to know that for internet archive they can scan around 1000 pages per day. We also went to the cis ( centre for internet and society ) stall. I came to know more about the cis.   So wrapping up, the fifth elephant by Hasgeek was good. The event organizers did a good job in making the sessions running on time. When I was at osidays in 2010, what I faced was some sessions will exceed the time given that will create issues with other sessions running in parallel. So the people who love to attend session  in A1 and then loved to move to A2 or A3 will get into trouble. Either they want to skip the last minutes of the talk on one place to join the other or the other session may not have ended there. But this didn&#8217;t happened once in the fifth elephant.   The organizers also did a good job for the food. We had tea/snacks in morning and evening and lunch in afternoon. I feel 2500 rupees was worth and affordable for a techie. The problem with osidays is they have many passes which costs much more price. And also the sessions sometimes overlaps. The rate of pass if something like 2500 is an affordable one for I want to spend more on lodging also. So the total cost of the event will again go up in my accomodation and travelling. But this time I have submitted my talk for osidays and foss.in. I am looking forward to see what will happen whether I get a chance as a speaker or not :-) .   I talked with the geeks at flipkart whom I met on Hacknight. Thanks to Vivek Mehta for offering me a flipkart T-shirt. But unfortunately  the size they gave me was small, for they felt its same as that of Medium. But I cannot enter my head through that hole :P . Probably the wrong decision by me not asking again for the Medium. Anyway I will give it to someone as a present, though I wished I could keep it remembering my day on HackNight.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>9:30 - 10:15 : Crunching Big Data, Google Scale by Rahul Kulkarni   I was little bit late, but it was something interesting to know about bigquery.cloud.google.com . I am still trying to figure out how I can make use of these stuffs. Its really a cool thing to hackon.     10:15 - 11:00 : In Data We Believe Harish Pillay of Red Hat   This talk was also an interesting one to learn and know about glusters. I met some of these guys of glusters at the Redhat stall. Gluster was an open-source tool which was developed by guys at Bangalore and later acquired by Redhat. It was something great to know about it.     11:00 – 11:30 : Tea and chitchat. It was interesting to meet the Hacknight guys Sidharth, Siju, Raison etc.   11:30 – 12:15 : An Introduction to Data Visualization and Processing by Uttam Grandhi   Uttam presented nicely. He was so cool and shared how the Japanese fountain shows the numbers and stuffs in fountain.     He also showed how we can working with Processing a java based tool and how we can visualize without data itself.   12:15 – 1:00 : Visualizing Text by S Anand of Gramener.com   Yes S Anand is so popular among developers. Yes I know him via s-anand.net some years back. But I wan&#8217;t able to recognize him when he was infront of me at #Hacknight. But this time I didn&#8217;t missed to say &#8220;Hi&#8221; to him. He with his collegue presented the talk so awesome. I as a participant feel that was the awesome talk of the day. He presents stuffs in a different way. I liked it. There was a difference in the way he speaks. Yes that makes him different from others. He mentioned about wordle.net, sip.s-anand.net, trendsmap.com, openbible.info, sentimental analysis, circular vizualisation and many more.     1:00 – 2:00 we had an awesome Lunch   2:00 – 2:30 Looking Beyond the Usual Suspects for Near Real-time Analytics on Big Data by Navjot Sidhu of Paypal. When we hear about people who has more problems than what we face, we know ours is not a big problem at all. Navjot Sidhu mentioned paypal having 500 transactions per second, 25 TB data and stuffs like that. I wonder how paypal really scales. It was interesting to know that the core of paypal is C which is almost 75 % of the code. He also talked about the events firing for a single transaction. I remembered about the Aura.Signal for a while.     2:30 – 3:00 : Build Your Own Real-time Analytics and Visualization, Enable Complex Event Processing, Event Patterns and Aggregates by Ramesh Perumalsamy and Vishnu H. Rao of Flipkart.     It was nice to know about logstash, graylog2, elastic search, statsD, graphite etc. I want to explore some of them.   3:00 – 3:30 “I know what you are going to do next summer” – Predicting Repeat Purchase Behavior by using Bayesian Hierarchical model and Regression Techniques Biswajit Pal, Subhasish Mishra and Manav Shroff I expected something, but as the talk goes on I didn&#8217;t see much importance sitting over there. So left the hall and had a chat with the guys over the stall.   3:30 – 4:00 Oh Tea break :) .   4:00 – 4:30 : Building, Analyzing and Visualizing Large Graphs by Ashwin Rajeev There were lots of people for this talk than the room can accomodate. I was sitting on the floor. The session was interesting to learn more on graphs. He mentioned about rapheljs, d3.js as Uttam mentioned earlier in his talk.   4:30 – 5:00 : Approaches to ML Techniques on Real World Data by Venkata Ramana I was able to understand what he was trying to explain for I was at #Hacknight. But I feel most of them didn&#8217;t find the talk interesting.   5:00 – 5:30 : Build Your Own Search Engine by Siddhartha Reddy of flipkart.     This was an interesting talk. I learned something interesting. Indexer, Searcher, Text Analysis, Tokenisation, Stop Word Removal, Normalization, Case folding, Synonyms, Others, Stemming, Lemmatization etc.  He also showed Term document matrix, inverted index, ranking, inverse document frequency etc. He suggestested a text titled Introduction to Information Retrieval for further reading   http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/   And finally winding up day one with 5:30 – 6:15 Panel Discussion: Best Practices by Kalpana Krishnaswami, Prithvijit Roy, Joydeep Sen Sarma, Anand S, Rohit Chattar, Navjot Sidhu Moderated by Govind Kanshi   I don&#8217;t know how I missed to hear the talk Anand Chitipothu and Noufal Ibrahim - How the Internet Archive Preserves Petabytes of Data  </p>
