    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was working with Imagine recently. I want to create a standard width and height for the image that is created. Eg: 500 X 300 .</p>

<p>The user will be uploading different size images and I want to resize the image to X width and Y height. I was using imagine and the code helps to make this happen filling the blank space with white color without loosing aspect ratio.</p>

<p>```php resize image with imagine
&lt;?php
$source = 'image.jpeg';
$destination = 'resize.jpg';
$width  = 300;
$height = 500;</p>

<p>$imagine   = new Imagine\Gd\Imagine();
$size      = new Imagine\Image\Box($width, $height);
$mode      = Imagine\Image\ImageInterface::THUMBNAIL_INSET;
$resizeimg = $imagine->open($source)</p>

<pre><code>            -&gt;thumbnail($size, $mode);
</code></pre>

<p>$sizeR     = $resizeimg->getSize();
$widthR    = $sizeR->getWidth();
$heightR   = $sizeR->getHeight();</p>

<p>$preserve  = $imagine->create($size);
$startX = $startY = 0;
if ( $widthR &lt; $width ) {</p>

<pre><code>$startX = ( $width - $widthR ) / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>}
if ( $heightR &lt; $height ) {</p>

<pre><code>$startY = ( $height - $heightR ) / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>}
$preserve->paste($resizeimg, new Imagine\Image\Point($startX, $startY))</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;save($destination);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>A normal image of size 500 X 500</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/kitten.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="A cute kitten" alt="a kitten"></p>

<p>when resized to 300 X 200</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/resize-image300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="Image resized to 300X200" alt="resized image"></p>

<p>and 300 X 400</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/resize-image300x400.jpg" width="300" height="400" title="Image resized to 300X400" alt="resized image"></p>

<p>A huge Thanks to the person who helped me on Symfony2 irc to find the different modes. I am not recalling the irc handle currently. I will update once I remember the same.</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/09/23/workshop-on-aura-project-for-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am really excited and at the same time a bit nervous, that I will be giving a workshop on <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for PHP</a> at <a href="http://www.osidays.com/">osidays</a>, which will be held at NIMHANS convention center Bangalore on 12-14 th of October 2012. I have received only the confirmation call, but not any mail as of now. If you have never heard of osidays, its one of the Asia's largest open-source conference held. The workshop will be for around 3 Hours. I will be walking you through different components of aura and finally to show how you can use the individual libraries as a framework. If you have never heard about the aura project, its an independent library which can be dropped at any codebase. You can find the source code and more information of the project at <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">https://github.com/auraphp</a> . I know 3 Hours of continuous speech is a huge challenge. I will try my level best to make the workshop interesting. I will be also discussing with <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a> how I can make it more informative. In-order to attend the workshop I feel you need to grab the platinum pass. Looking forward meeting you guys at osidays :) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/09/15/contributor-to-aura-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started my career with PHP I have been hearing about PEAR and Symfony a lot. <a href="http://joseantony.com/">Jose Antony</a> was the person who introduced the names <a href="http://symfony-project.org">Symfony</a>, <a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</a>, <a href="http://propelorm.org">Propel</a> etc. But at work I never got a chance to touch on those. But my thirst to learn and explore moved me from Cochin to Bangalore and different websites. I played with Symfony in my free time ( Jobeet ). symfony-project was having good articles and videos to move with. I was working for a client who was interested in <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> and asked me to go for a try. It was a hard time in 2009 for me that, the documentation was poor ( from a point of me ) and there wasn't a proper structure for people doing Zend Framework before the introduction of ZF tool in 1.8 ( I guess ) . The way it works and I wasn't either familiar with irc or how I can get some help. Yes it was mainly not the Zend Framework or the community issues. It was my problems to understand from where I can get help. There wasn't a good source to ask how I can use irc or get more information other than search internet. I really struggled with Zend Framework. Google was the only help which can find blog posts on errors and implementation. Some will work, some will not. I still remember the autoload error thrown which mentioned about this will be deprecated in Zend Framework 2 ( IIRC ). lol I wasn't either able to understand looking at those errors. I was having a thought that frameworks cannot be developed by people like me :) . Why I thought so was I was hearing about design patterns a lot and I never properly understood what the hell it was. I failed to find a good mentor. I wrote some blog posts on <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">zend framework</a> to help people who start with it. I wasn't either sure whether I was doing the right things. When I published the post, I did submitted a small intro to <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> with a note to verify whether I was doing it right. But the editor was busy that he mentioned its not possible to check. But some how it was published in <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> . I looked for the person who submitted the article and found it was <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt</a>. I never know about him earlier, but later understood he was the person behind <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> itself :) . In the mean time I did made some changes to the brief information at <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">devzone</a> and submitted it. The article brought lots of visitors and my 1 GB bandwidth got exceed for the 1st time in my life. My friend <a href="http://prajizworld.com">Prajith</a> who was in charge of the server quickly increased the limit when he got my call. This article brought me some opportunity to work with <a href="http://packtpub.com">Packt publishers</a>. Around 2009 or 2010 I came to know about a project called <a href="http://lithify.me">lithium</a> via a podcast. I was interested to learn how the frameworks are build. It was using the awesome PHP 5.3 , so I thought of looking into it. At osidays <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcoallier">David Coallier</a> gave an awesome talk on PHP 5.3 . I was able to meet <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org">Fabien Potencier</a> and get an autograph signed. I did meet some awesome PHP gurus at osidays. I started to look more closely into lithium which was in development. I wasn't able to help for I was not that much strong on the concepts. They were using their own git server hosted at <a href="http://dev.lithify.me">dev.lithify.me</a> . I was not comfortable with <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a>, but when we search for git related help, it will be from <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> docs. So I asked about switching the lithium to github for the leaders were having their own reasons to host it there. As I told I was starting with git, I pushed to master in my fork which I wasn't either sure how I can send Pull Request . Again not the problem with the leaders. <a href="https://twitter.com/nateabele">Nate</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/gwoo">Gwoo</a> etc helped me a lot when I got stuck with cloning the repo and errors. I learned some of the git commands, PHP 5.3 etc. I tried to help with testing the mysql stuffs which was done by <a href="https://github.com/Howard3">Howard</a>. Though I tried to contribute stuffs it didn't happened for I failed to understand the process completely. I also looked closely <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2</a>, but was a bit hard for me. In the early 2011 I got introduced to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">aura project for php</a> via the blog post of <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones</a>. I have earlier looked <a href="http://solarphp.com">SolarPHP</a> , so he was a familiar face. I started to play with it. I also understood the design principles were clearly <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp">mailed in the group</a>, so I found the real mentor whom I was searching. IIRC I forked the <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com">auraphp.github.com</a> and made some changes to the style from that of <a href="http://friendsofsymfony.github.com">friendsofsymfony.github.com</a> , and probably that was my first commit to an opensource project . I started to talk on irc and give some patches and bug reports and slowly I became a member of the organization <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">auraphp</a> . I know my earlier commits were not going on the right way( I mean the git workflow ), but Paul did merged than closing it or gave suggestions what to do and why you should not go that way etc. He do gave credits for the bugs or suggestions we share in group. Yes it was real joy for people when your commits to an open-source is merged and when you get credits for the work you do. I have noticed people who do just close the PR for there was some error the way the PR is given or if its not the way its expected. I encourage leaders to at-least correct the mistakes than closing the PR with another commit which is already waiting for merge. People who come to open-source are interested to share and learn, not just download the code and use what you are building. They loved to hear why you choose the particular design pattern than blindly using with it, at-least me love it. Note : There is no hatred to any of the projects or leaders. Every one has tried to help me learn various stuffs. It was my failures, to understand it. I fear sometimes the way we think to express may not be read between words. That is the main reason I have kept this note. I know I have not covered everyone and many of the stuffs have been missed. But its not intentionally . But I would like to Thank all for the various helps you have provided via irc, twitter, facebook, mails etc. I did had a great time learning new stuffs. Thanks once again, lets share and learn.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reading <a href="http://sandeep.shetty.in/2012/05/when-to-use-arraymerge-and-union.html">When to use array_merge and union operator (+) in PHP?</a> . Lately working with examples I was also confused how the array_merge and union works. Really, that brings a strong thought why you should write tests. Lets see some examples . {syntaxhighlighter class="php"} 'bar', 3, 4, '123' => 3); echo '$a = '; var_export($a); $b = array('foo' => 'baz', 3, 6, 7, 3); echo PHP_EOL . '$b = '; var_export($b); echo PHP_EOL . 'array_merge( $a, $b) = '; var_export( array_merge($a, $b)); echo PHP_EOL . '$a + $b = '; var_export( $a + $b ); {/syntaxhighlighter} Do you have any thoughts on how the result for array_merge and + comes? {syntaxhighlighter class="php"} $a = array ( 'foo' => 'bar', 0 => 3, 1 => 4, 123 => 3, ) $b = array ( 'foo' => 'baz', 0 => 3, 1 => 6, 2 => 7, 3 => 3, ) array_merge( $a, $b) = array ( 'foo' => 'baz', 0 => 3, 1 => 4, 2 => 3, 3 => 3, 4 => 6, 5 => 7, 6 => 3, ) $a + $b = array ( 'foo' => 'bar', 0 => 3, 1 => 4, 123 => 3, 2 => 7, 3 => 3, ) {/syntaxhighlighter} Hope this makes to convince you also , why you should write tests :-) . A detailed post on the working is at http://unix0.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/php-array_merge-vs-plus-union-operator/</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2012/06/01/standalone-menu-and-breadcrumb-in-php</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The era of standalone components is here. Yes people will definitely take and promote standalone components . Lets have a look into the <a href="http://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenu">KnpMenu</a> . Its awesome that you can create awesome menu . Yes with PHP and after all there is no dependencies . Lets see some examples {syntaxhighlighter class="php"} use Knp\Menu\MenuFactory; use Knp\Menu\Renderer\ListRenderer; $factory = new MenuFactory(); $menu = $factory->createItem('My menu'); $home = $menu->addChild('Home', array('uri' => '/')); $home1 = $home->addChild(' Home1', array('uri' => '/about')); $home1->addChild('Company', array('uri' => '/about/company')); $home1->addChild('Life', array('uri' => '/about/life')); $home1->addChild('Work', array('uri' => '/about/work')); $menu->addChild('Comments', array('uri' => '#comments')); $menu->addChild('Aura', array('uri' => 'http://auraphp.github.com/')); $menu->addChild('Coming soon'); $renderer = new ListRenderer(); echo $renderer->render($menu); {/syntaxhighlighter} The above will give you the below output. {syntaxhighlighter class="html"} -   <a href="/">Home</a>     -   <a href="/about">&lt; Home1</a>         -   <a href="/about/company">Company</a>         -   <a href="/about/life">Life</a>         -   <a href="/about/work">Work</a>   -   <a href="#comments">Comments</a> -   <a href="http://auraphp.github.com/">Aura</a> -   Coming soon  {/syntaxhighlighter} You can also create from an array. I was having some issue and Thank you Christophe Coevoet ( <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Stof70">@Stof70</a> ) for quickly helping me. I was copying some test data and didn't noticed one of the display value was hidden :P . So here it comes :-) . {syntaxhighlighter class="php"} use Knp\Menu\MenuFactory; use Knp\Menu\Renderer\ListRenderer; $factory = new MenuFactory(); $array = array( 'name' => 'test_menu', 'label' => "Home", 'uri' => 'homepage', 'attributes' => array(), 'labelAttributes' => array(), 'linkAttributes' => array(), 'display' => true, 'displayChildren' => true, 'children' => array( 'jack' => array( 'name' => 'jack', 'label' => "Jack", 'uri' => 'http://php.net', 'attributes' => array(), 'labelAttributes' => array(), 'linkAttributes' => array('title' => 'php'), 'display' => true, 'displayChildren' => true, 'children' => array( 'john' => array( 'name' => 'john', 'label' => "John", 'uri' => null, 'attributes' => array(), 'labelAttributes' => array(), 'linkAttributes' => array(), 'display' => true, 'displayChildren' => true, 'children' => array( 'doe' => array( 'name' => 'doe', 'label' => 'doe', 'uri' => 'http://google.com' ) ), ), ), ), 'joe' => array( 'name' => 'joe', 'label' => 'test', 'uri' => null, 'attributes' => array('class' => 'leaf'), 'labelAttributes' => array('class' => 'center'), 'linkAttributes' => array(), 'display' => true, 'displayChildren' => false, 'children' => array(), ), ), ); $menu = $factory->createFromArray($array); $renderer = new ListRenderer(); echo $renderer->render($menu); {/syntaxhighlighter} And this will print the below html. Consider making values hidden etc . You can notice how the output changes. {syntaxhighlighter class="html"} -   <a href="http://php.net" title="php">jack</a>     -   john         -   <a href="http://google.com">doe</a>   -   test  {/syntaxhighlighter} There is Breadcrumb also in the latest 2.0 master branch ( Not yet released ? ) . I have not explored more how we can make it . I will update the post once I play with the Breadcrumbs. So good bye to Zend_Navigation. Its a new beginning for <a href="http://knplabs.com/">Knplabs</a> , KnpMenu . Ryan Weaver deserves some credits for its a port of http://github.com/weaverryan/ioMenuPlugin ( symfony 1 plugin, but for the PHP community as a whole ). Source Code : http://github.com/knplabs/KnpMenu Its already having great documentation :) . Go and explore guys .. Look through tests if you have doubts ;-) . Ask support at Symfony irc . May be at a different one later ?</p>
