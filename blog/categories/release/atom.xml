    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Paul M Jones tagged the beta5 for the system repo.</p>

<p>So you can download the system from <a href="http://auraphp.com/system/downloads">http://auraphp.com/system/downloads/</a></p>

<h2>via composer</h2>

<p>Creating aura framework based projects has been made easy with composer. You can run</p>

<pre><code>php composer.phar create-project -s dev aura/system your-directory
</code></pre>

<p>What it does is almost similar to git clone and installing via git as below</p>

<p>via git</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/auraphp/system
cd system
php update.php
</code></pre>

<p>you can also skip php update.php with</p>

<pre><code>php composer.phar install
</code></pre>

<p>You can read some basic introduction from <a href="http://auraphp.com/system">http://auraphp.com/system/</a></p>

<p>NB : If you haven't heard about composer you can read it from <a href="http://getcomposer.org">getcomposer.org</a></p>
