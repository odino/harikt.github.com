    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reading the post <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/">Symfony2 Form Architecture</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/webmozart">Bernhard Schussek</a> . The main aim of his post was to make use of Symfony2 form component in Zend Framework 2 as the form architecture which was written in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Forms">RFC</a> seems almost the same. This is a small feedback I would love to give as I am interested to make the Form as a standalone component, what ever framework we are using.  These all started with probably @fabpot tweets about it .     > Is it just me or is the <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23ZF2">#ZF2</a> > form RFC heavily inspired by > <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Symfony2">#Symfony2</a>? /cc > @<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a> > <a href="http://t.co/cRf01a3X" title="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Forms">framework.zend.com/wiki/display/Z…</a> > > — Fabien Potencier (@fabpot) > <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/174153351372611584">February 27, 2012</a>     Some months back as of Symfony2 stable was released I tried to incorporate the Form component to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">Aura Project for PHP</a> which was aiming for 5.3 at that time. But now looking forward to 5.4 + only  Let have a look into the Symfony2 dependencies for Form component which is described in pear.symfony.com   EventDispatcher, Validator, Locale .  AuraPHP already have a Signal / Slot / Event Handler , so it doesn't need the EventDispatcher, like the same ZF2 already have one, so I feel EventDispatcher is not needed for both the frameworks. Lets don't think what we have, lets see whether adding these components really solve in creating to make it as a standalone component ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/6813319456/" title="Sf2Form by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/6813319456_3441d6be49.jpg" alt="Sf2Form" /></a>  I have taken a screenshot of the tweets I got in reply. Thanks to all who tried to help me .Below is the link to the details, and I hope you can go more detailed on the tweets if needed.  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> You don't need Twig. Simply > the Twig form rendering is easier to get standalone. the PHP one is > in the bundle @<a href="https://twitter.com/weaverryan">weaverryan</a> > @<a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot">fabpot</a> > > — Christophe Coevoet (@Stof70) > <a href="https://twitter.com/Stof70/status/142643884047089664">December 2, 2011</a>     So what is missing for Symfony2 form component ? It needs more components as shown in the gist  below     So to conclude though the Symfony2 Form mentions as a standalone, its not a standalone component at-least looking from a user point of view like me. You can see various people asking about how to use Symfony2 Form component as a standalone in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/symfony-users/aAqDJjkl2gQ">google groups</a>. But what people points is to Silex again build on the shoulder of Symfony2 component . I am not against Symfony2 , please don't feel so. But I just want to bring the fact that, than writing a big architecture, people would be looking how we can integrate it as standalone .  So in my view I am looking forward to see how ZF2 will make a change from Symfony2 or will it be the same like binding everything . I am also looking forward to see how <a href="http://auraphp.github.com">Aura project for PHP 5.4</a> can bring Form . I have limited knowledge, so I may be wrong on the above things too. Feel free to correct me  I am looking for something like the one below, yes of-course we need validation and stuffs , but it will be standalone , no matter :-) .      &lt;?php     //PFBC 2.x PHP 5 >= 5.3     session_start();     include($<em>SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/PFBC/Form.php");     $form = new PFBC\Form("GettingStarted", 300);     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Textbox("My Textbox:", "MyTextbox"));     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Select("My Select:", "MySelect", array(        "Option #1",        "Option #2",        "Option #3"     )));     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Button);     $form->render();      //PFBC 2.x PHP 5     session_start();     include($</em>SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/PFBC/Form.php");     $form = new Form("GettingStarted", 300);     $form->addElement(new Element_Textbox("My Textbox:", "MyTextbox"));     $form->addElement(new Element_Select("My Select:", "MySelect", array(        "Option #1",        "Option #2",        "Option #3"     )));     $form->addElement(new Element_Button);     $form->render();     ?>  An example where I can show such a standalone one is http://code.google.com/p/php-form-builder-class/ . Currently to render the form either you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/TwigBridge">TwigBridge</a> or <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle">FrameworkBundle</a> .  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> There is 2 implementations: > TwigBridge and in FrameworkBundle but you could write one for > Aura.View /cc @<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a> > > — Christophe Coevoet (@Stof70) > <a href="https://twitter.com/Stof70/status/177148060881788929">March 6, 2012</a>  If you are using Framework bundle you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle/blob/master/Templating/Helper/FormHelper.php">Templating component</a> and to my understanding if you are using TwigBundle you need Twig itself . So is this a standalone ? Also if its really a standalone why it didn't find a documentation as in http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html . The Symfony2 has released months back, so I don't feel Symfony2 form is a standalone in the sense as I shown in the example .</p>
