  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was trying with two new addons . SkipScreen and Screengrab which is similar to FireShot but something extra .  SkipScreen is used to skip the wait time . For eg : When we try to download some files from rapid share we may need to wait for 150 seconds . This wait time will be reduced when you are using the skip screen . This will skip the wait time not only of rapid share , but for the many sites . I hope this will be  a wonderful tool for you if you are using the skipscreen addon of Mozilla firefox .  Screengrab which is similar to FireShot . But it has some more features . Both Screengrab and Fireshot is  a great tool especailly for web-developers . For eg : When we are adding a portfolio for a site we may need to grab a portion or the entire page. I have used the print screen and then the photoshop to make it. But now its simple with the help of screengrab and Fireshot . Both can take the entire page or the viewable part in the browser . But Screengrab can take a particular portion . You need just to drag the selection . It will get the screenshot for you . So no need to go and edit . But you can use photoshop or any other tool if needed .  Browse the other wonderful collection of addons from mozilla firefox and let me know what you think about the other .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was viewing Tech crunch site at techcrunch.com .  There was a post claiming about the new advertisement made by Oracle in the European edition of the Wall Street Journal . You may love to see the advertisement . We can call this as a comedy or something serious or like a warning in lighter words .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3906567985/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3906567985_265ae36bdf.jpg" alt="Oracle and sun advertisement a comedy" /></a>  Its such a beautiful quotes .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Testing is really pain . How do you figure that all the code you write is fully functional ? For eg : 5 divided by 0 will give you a Math error . So you may need to test our codes . Phpunit is a tool to test your codes . Recently I was trying to learn to write test cases as I started learning Zend framework . There are many automated testing tools like phpunit . You can explore it if needed .  Another one is the phpundercontrol ( I was hearing about this in many blogs and php magazines )  . It can be installed with phpunit . Its also a great tool to see the graphical representation of the php performance . I have not looked much, so do visit the sites and get more informations about it .  http://www.phpunit.de  http://phpundercontrol.org  http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3858966507_9aef76db9d.jpg" alt="image" />Learning Zend framework made me explore many new tools . The selenium IDE which is an add on for Mozilla is a wonderful tool for testers . For eg : we are humans and we may forget the actions done what all things we do . But we can record our clicks and inputs using selenium IDE . So when an error occurs we can show the developer what happens and what was the input entered etc .  I am really excited to see the Selenium IDE . I hope you testers and developers too will love this wonderful addon . Currently Selenium is supported by the browsers given below .  I have taken the list from the site . So if you are interested please do visit the site and get more information .  Browser Selenium IDE Selenium Remote Control Selenium Core Firefox 3 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests Firefox 2 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests IE 8b1 not supported ? ? IE 7 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 3 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 2 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 9 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 8 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Others not supported Partial support possible* Run tests**</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about Bhuvan recently . I was little busy , but after receiving a mail with subject &#8220;Bhuvan: ISRO&#8217;s answer to google earth&#8221; I thought of looking the site .  This is the address . http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/ . I saw new news Bhuvan is available in Mozilla firefox and netscape .  Bhuvan is only for the geographical area of India only . But I don&#8217;t think whether it will gain much popularity if they have not supported or developed a plugin for GNU/Linux or in common *nix systems . I think many of the Indians are now opensource lovers and have moved to *nix platform . So the ISRO which is a goverment body must really support the opensource projects rather than developing something for properitery OS. Now the web is a platform which makes the OS independent . So try to make something which is not an OS dependent software .  I hope they may come with a plugin for *nix systems . I would like to explore Bhuvan after that , and now its not an answer for Google earth . Google earth can be viewed from *nix systems .  This is for ISRO people <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , track your site vistors Operating system and Browser and compare . You can see the difference . Google analytics is a good one or you can go for piwik an opensource web analytics tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning Zendframework . When you are working on some frameworks you need a good IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) . There are many IDE&#8217;s that are opensource and properitery . I was using Aptana once and then jumped to Eclipse . Recently I got a Zendstudio i5 licence . I was very Happy to see the Zendstudio licence.  If they have not given me a licence I may not be able to buy one too . I don&#8217;t earn that much money a month lol .  I have loved to buy many videos and studio . But I was unable as I don&#8217;t have as much penny in my pocket. Anyway I got the Zendstudio-i5 which is a Perpetual license . So I am trying the IDE and will let you know how it looks and what are the things new in it .  Keeping a screenshot of the zendstudio i5 .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2597/3847184227_2dfa1c6eaa.jpg" alt="Zendstudio i5 to make easy development of Zendframework projects" />  Bye and Thanks Zend once again for giving me one copy .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello Guys  Are you new to Zend Framework ? Are you new to MVC ?  Then really you may have thought like me . Where to start and how to start ? Am I right ?  Then this is post is for you my dear friend . I can admit one thing that learning Zend framework is hard though there is a big documentation . There is good examples to the components too . But we will not understand how to bind each other ? Am I right ?  I am also new to Zend Framework . I like the ZF command line most. I looked for many articles , but many was in the old style . Recently I came to a pdf document which was very interesting which is used to administer the site . Every one will look for how to create an admin side using zend frameowork greater than 1.8 . Now its 1.9 too .  I am keeping the pdf which was seen from Slideshare by <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com/">Nick Belhomme</a>. This is a great one for each and every one to start . Hope it may help you . There are many more people who writes about Zendframework in their blog. I recently created a search to search those sites which I think may be helpful to you too . So you can explore it too . The link is <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje">http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje</a>  Good Luck guys . Explore the search engine and grab the Zend Framework .  Bye for now . You can see some from me too in the coming days . lol  Have created the base files need to start your zend framework project . Check it out from http://harikt.com/content/base-files-start-your-zend-framework-project . Thanks to all who have supported me knowingly or unknowingly :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was trying the Zend framework . So these are some of the things that I have learned after the start .  Hope you have installed and configured Zend framework .Please do use some nice IDE&#8217;s like the Eclipse PDT or Aptana or the Zend Studio . The IDE&#8217;s are very helpful when you work on projects with zend framework . Please add the include path to Eclipse so it will automatically show the list of methods and members available . Also please do look the coding standards that every one is following especially the Zend .  1 ) Creating a project  # zf create project mysite  *mysite is the name of the project  2 ) Creating a controller  # zf create controller user  * user is the controller . You can use the small letters itself . The command line will add UserController class .  # zf create action login user  * login is the action , user is the controller .  So the code will produce loginAction method in the class UserController .  3 ) You can create a module for admin using  # zf create module admin  4 ) Creating a controller for module  # zf create controller add 1 admin  5 ) Creating an action for add controller in the admin module  # zf create action blog add 1 admin  You can see help also . Just type zf will show you the all available options .</p>
