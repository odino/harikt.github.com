  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2509/4005823080_2cddac3e94_m.jpg" alt="Secure network" />After the session by Manu Zacharia ( An ISO 27001-2005 lead auditor , Director Information Security &#8230; ) from Barcamp 6, I thought of looking closely my system and who all are trying to get into the system. Yes, he was correct . We can see the attempts from different IP&#8217;s and I just looked to get the details of the IP address .  Many of the IP&#8217;s which where in the events blocked where from New Delhi and the ISP was BSNL . I don&#8217;t even know whether these guys are crackers or not . Some of the IP&#8217;s that where reported in the blocked events where from Singapore too .( Not looked all the IP details and events ).  I was wondering about the case of common people who don&#8217;t know much about the problems and attacks like this . Is their network secure ? Even though there is good administrators , the many portals are cracked. So guys, go for open-source products , so the code is open and you can check , rather than getting a free or shareware softwares and asking a cracker to enter in your system . Be secured with some great firewall .  Don&#8217;t go for a properitery firewall, go for opensource . Once again I am remembering you . I am planning to learn something about the security system , so that it will help me in the webdevelopment to make it much more secure than what I know now. I think every coder must learn how attacks are happening than just writing some code for money, so can make the things much more secure. We all know about XSS attack and many sites are being attacked each day now too. Why its so ? Is the coder aware how to secure it ? Yes the first thing is to learn about the attack and how its happening and then we have to stop anymore attacks like it in the future. So according to me, I think a coder must learn about security systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The sixth barcamp kerala which was held on Rajgiri college cochin ( RASAT ) ended with colors . The college campus of Rajgiri was a beautiful one. I just thought of my campus days at CUIET ( Nostalgic feelings ) .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4005098016/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2636/4005098016_c79bb99238.jpg" alt="Barcamp6 at Rajgiri college" /></a>  Photo credits to Kenny  It was really a colorful campus ( We cannot compare CUIET to Rajgiri , you must see both the college to understand why I am saying so ). The event was on the main building and there was a beautiful pond infront of it and some geese where swimming in it ( Awesome ) . Keeping a picture of it ( photo credits to Jins Abraham which was on the Barcamp site <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4004409621/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2672/4004409621_8607c1d308.jpg" alt="Geese in the front of Rajgiri college cochin" /></a>  There was a total of eight sessions . As I am attending Barcamp for the second time I was familiar with many of them . It was really great fun to share things and see the great guys . One of the nice talks was by Arun Basi Lal of Millionclues . Its hard to see people like Arun Basi Lal who is a studying for BTech and attending Barcamps . Many of them never looked like this events . If you are into some professional colleges , then I think you should atleast participate in events like this . I know the limitations , but it will be really useful in your future especially when you are out from college . I remember the one of the presentation in Barcamp five by Binny V A , &#8220;What they don&#8217;t teach you in college&#8221; and I agree with it . Many people who came to Barcamp have achieved something only because of their hardwork . Though the event was from Rajgiri a professional college , only a few from the college where present .  Another session by Manu Zacharia of Milleninnium IT consultants was a great one about Ethical Hacking , &#8220;Hacking in its real sense&#8221; . The one I remember about his talk was about the 7 line shell script which make Windows 7 down . ( To the persons who are hearing the term hacking for the first time , consider looking the ietf http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2828.txt for the difference between hacker and cracker ).  The Anand ( He is popularly called as The Anand ie why writte so ) introduced the concept of carpooling which must be introduced in the cities of India . Its really good to see group of people of same likes moving in a city than going single in each car . There are lots of advatages . You can think about it . Soon they may be coming with a portal .  All the remaining sessions where really interesting and finally we wrapped the event saying &#8220;See you in the next Barcamp&#8221; .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116483191/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4116483191_d540894cf7.jpg" alt="Barcamp 6 Kerala" /></a>  I was walking with Nithin and we took some snaps from the campus . Will upload it soon after getting those pictures . Before leaving Rajgiri we took a nice snap . Hope I will get the snaps of it soon .  Uploaded some of them to picasa . If you are intrested you can get it from http://picasaweb.google.com/kthari85/Barcamp6 .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was reading an article in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/10/06/css-frameworks-semantic-class-names/">sitepoint</a> about the css frameworks . Though I have heard about the css frameworks earlier I was not able to get completely . But after seeing the article I thought of looking once again deeply into it .  Some of the most commonly used css frameworks are  1 ) Blue print CSS : http://www.blueprintcss.org/  2 ) 960 Grid system : http://960.gs/  3 ) YUI Grid : http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/  4 ) Elastic : http://elasticss.com/  5 ) YAML : http://www.yaml.de/en/ and many more .  You may be thinking why I thought of writing about CSS framework though I am a PHP developer ? Am I right ? Recently I got a chance to slice a website . As I am doing for the first time , it takes some time to complete it . The problems every one face is browser compatibility . Here comes the use of these frameworks .  These comes with inbuilt classes for the need and is fully tested <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But the only problem is with the name of the class ( Eg : grid_1 prefix_6 suffix_5 ) . What makes me interested to look again to the css frameworks after reading the sitepoint article is we can make custom classes now .  Yes every designers will be using the class names like header , footer , content , sidebar etc rather than the css grid_1 , grid_2 &#8230;. grid_15 . Though name is not a big deal for a good designer it makes some easiness for guys who donot have much css background .  We can download the psd of the grid systems and slice the website with the size provided in it . A screenshot taken from 960 grid is given below . Look carefully the menu and other parts and see how its done . We should use the grid system when we start designing it . So will help much not to arrange any more text and images to left and right when we start slicing it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3989881052/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3989881052_2e6d5a5d1a_o.png" alt="960 grid css framework example" /></a>  Thus we can increase our productivity for the sites ( As its tested in many browsers you may never spend much time. ) . It may take a few additional hours when we are new . But it will be really helpful in the future when slicing web site . Wish you good luck and try slicing a psd from scratch using your favourite css frameworks.  Updated : Now 960 grid system has one more layout , 24 column . Previously was only having 12 and 16 . I want to redesign this site using 960 grid . Hope I can come with a nice design for this drupal site . Want to brush up the theming concepts . Many things in the to do list .</p>

Recaptcha is a wonderful service that stops spam like mollom of Dries Butt . If you have a mail id , then you may know what spam is . Gmail may be the best mail service which can protect spam . Now adays every mail service do like that . But gmail seems to be much better than any .  If you have a website with a contact form , you can notice that it will be the most visited page . As a webdeveloper we should use a captcha service to block spam . Else our domain will be listed in the domain which generates spam . Recaptcha is a free service that can protect your forms from spam . There are many plugins or modules for wordpress , drupal etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3931206156/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2507/3931206156_351f973d40.jpg" alt="MolloM" /></a>I am using mollom for protecting my forms as its a project developed by Dries the author of Drupal . Thanks to mollom too . I love mollom because it will not show the captcha unless it thinks its spam . There may be many other wonderful services like Mollom and recaptcha . You can use it, according to your taste .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Adding a WYSIWYG editor to Zend_Textarea element of zend framework . I don&#8217;t know whether this is the right way to this . Anyway I would love to share the piece of code to you . I am using the ckeditor the opensource WYSIWYG editor which was previously called fckeditor. I love the new look of it than the tiny mce . So switched to it <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Extract the files of ckeditor and upload to public folder . I am keeping this in the /js/ckeditor .  Add the below piece of code to the layout . As we dont need to load the js of the ckeditor every time we can add a flag.      &lt;?php         if ( $this->ckeditor ) {             echo $this->headScript()->appendFile( $this->baseUrl().&#8217;/js/ckeditor/ckeditor.js&#8217;);          }     ?>  Now you need a helper . Keep the below code in /application/views/helpers/SetupEditor.php .      &lt;?php     class Zend_View_Helper_SetupEditor {          function setupEditor( $textareaId ) {             return &#8221;<script type=\"text/javascript\">         CKEDITOR.replace( '". $textareaId ."' );             </script>&#8221;;         }     }     ?>  I have used a baseUrl helper also . So if you are new I am keeping it for those .      &lt;?php     class Zend_View_Helper_BaseUrl {         function baseUrl() {             $fc = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();             return $fc->getBaseUrl();         }     }     ?>  Now you can include the small piece of code in the view script where you are printing the form . For this eg: I am using the application/views/scripts/index/edit.phtml      &lt;?php         $this->ckeditor = &#8216;ckeditor&#8217;; //To tell the layout ckeditor must be loaded .     ?>     <h2>Edit Post</h2>     <div>&lt;?php echo $this->postForm; ?></div>     <!-- Description is the id of the textarea -->     &lt;?php echo $this->setupEditor( &#8216;Description&#8217; ); ?>  You must know the name of the id of the textarea to pass to the setupEditor . I have used the name Description when creating the textarea element . You must have atleast tried the Zend framework quickstart to understand how it works . I hope I have not missed any .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was trying to use pagination I didnot find a complete example . From different blogs and mannuals I finally figured it . So I thought of posting it for myself and for others trying to learn it .  You need to grab the result and pass to Zend_Paginator .      /<em>     * Get the page number , default 1     </em>/     $page = $this->_getParam(&#8216;page&#8217;,1);     /<em>     * Object of Zend_Paginator     </em>/     $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($result);     /<em>     * Set the number of counts in a page     </em>/     $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(2);     /<em>     * Set the current page number     </em>/     $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);     /<em>     * Assign to view     </em>/     $this->view->paginator = $paginator;  I hope you have this code in the indexAction . If its in indexAction add the below code in the index.phtml view script , else according to the view of your Action .      <h1>Example</h1>     &lt;?php if (count($this->paginator)): ?>     <ul>     &lt;?php     /<em>     * Iterate through the paginator to show the results     </em>/     foreach ($this->paginator as $item): ?>     <li>&lt;?php echo $item[&#8216;FirstName&#8217;] .&#8221; &#8220;.$item[&#8216;LastName&#8217;]; ?></li>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     </ul>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     &lt;?php     /<em>     * Print the pagination of type , drop down or search type or of your choice.     </em>/     echo $this->paginationControl($this->paginator,                                         &#8216;Sliding&#8217;,                                         &#8216;/partials/my_pagination_control.phtml&#8217;); ?>  This code is from the zend mannuals , but it didnot tell where to keep this . You need to keep this in the views folder . I am keeping it in application/views/scripts/partials/my_pagination_control.phtml . I have added the 3 types of pagination in this . You can remove or comment it and look how each type of pagination looks . The drop down is uncommented for now .      &lt;?php     /<em>     * Search pagination     </em>/     ?>     &lt;?php /<em>if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <div class="paginationControl">     <!-- Previous page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>     <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->previous)); ?>&#8221;> &lt;&lt; Previous</a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>     <span class="disabled">&lt; Previous</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Numbered page links -->     &lt;?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>     &lt;?php if ($page != $this->current): ?>         <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $page)); ?>&#8221;>             &lt;?php echo $page; ?>         </a> |       &lt;?php else: ?>         &lt;?php echo $page; ?> |       &lt;?php endif; ?>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     <!-- Next page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->next)); ?>&#8221;>         Next &gt;       </a>     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Next &gt;</span>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     </div>     &lt;?php endif; </em>/?>     &lt;?php     /<em>      </em> Item pagination example      <em>      </em>/     ?>     <!--     See http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=itempagination     -->     &lt;?php /<em>if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <div class="paginationControl">     &lt;?php echo $this->firstItemNumber; ?> - &lt;?php echo $this->lastItemNumber; ?>     of &lt;?php echo $this->totalItemCount; ?>     <!-- First page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->first)); ?>&#8221;>First </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">First</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Previous page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->previous)); ?>&#8221;> &lt; Previous  </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">&lt; Previous</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Next page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->next)); ?>&#8221;>  Next &gt; </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Next &gt;</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Last page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->last)); ?>&#8221;>  Last  </a>     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Last</span>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     </div>     &lt;?php endif; </em>/?>     &lt;?php     /<em>      </em> Drop down paginaton example      */     ?>     &lt;?php if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <select id="paginationControl" size="1">     &lt;?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>       &lt;?php $selected = ($page == $this->current) ? &#8217; selected=&#8221;selected&#8221;&#8217; : &#8221;; ?>       <option value="<?php             echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $page));?>&#8221;&lt;?php echo $selected ?>>         &lt;?php echo $page; ?>       </option>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     </select>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.0.2/prototype.js"></script>     <script type="text/javascript">     $('paginationControl').observe('change', function() {         window.location = this.options[this.selectedIndex].value;     })     </script>  Hope it works for you .

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://windows7sins.org/"><img src="http://windows7sins.org/i/widget.png" alt="Windows 7 Sins" /></a>Though Microsoft has not officially released the Windows 7 , their new operating system , FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) has started the site http://windows7sins.org/ . Many of you may be knowing Vista was a major failure for Microsoft , I got a chance to see the operating system from one of my friend . Its really a tough job to use it . May be because I was new to Vista and I was not using Windows XP . There are lots of changes in the Control panel itself which was really complicated to many people I think after they are coming from a Windows XP background .  As microsoft is telling their new OS will be light and users dont need to upgrade the hardware or buy new PC as Vista , we may need to see it . I don&#8217;t know how much profit will the make after the release of Windows 7 as Google itself is into the OS market with the new Google chrome which is an opensource OS running on top of Linux kernel .  If microsoft stops the Internet Explorer browser then  webdevelopers like me don&#8217;t want to work on windows from office too . As many of them are still using IE to browse the web. I do recommend Mozilla firefox for safer and faster browsing which is another opensource webbrowser which was once backed by the support of Google itself .  Guys I recommend you to use any distro of GNU/Linux . The Ubuntu one of the debain based distro may be the popular one used by many users for the cannonical was sending free CD&#8217;s to home . There are lots of opensource and GPL based softwares . Enjoy the freedom of GNU/GPL and opensource .  I am a developer so I love to see the new technology and will try to learn from it . So I am not against the company or its product but only to the properitery licence . Linus Torvalds has once told in the introduction of git in google summer of code that he don&#8217;t trust every one, and only trust a few . Like the same as I am a developer I don&#8217;t trust all but the community . So we may sometimes need to look into the code to know how it works . Am I right ?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was trying with two new addons . SkipScreen and Screengrab which is similar to FireShot but something extra .  SkipScreen is used to skip the wait time . For eg : When we try to download some files from rapid share we may need to wait for 150 seconds . This wait time will be reduced when you are using the skip screen . This will skip the wait time not only of rapid share , but for the many sites . I hope this will be  a wonderful tool for you if you are using the skipscreen addon of Mozilla firefox .  Screengrab which is similar to FireShot . But it has some more features . Both Screengrab and Fireshot is  a great tool especailly for web-developers . For eg : When we are adding a portfolio for a site we may need to grab a portion or the entire page. I have used the print screen and then the photoshop to make it. But now its simple with the help of screengrab and Fireshot . Both can take the entire page or the viewable part in the browser . But Screengrab can take a particular portion . You need just to drag the selection . It will get the screenshot for you . So no need to go and edit . But you can use photoshop or any other tool if needed .  Browse the other wonderful collection of addons from mozilla firefox and let me know what you think about the other .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was viewing Tech crunch site at techcrunch.com .  There was a post claiming about the new advertisement made by Oracle in the European edition of the Wall Street Journal . You may love to see the advertisement . We can call this as a comedy or something serious or like a warning in lighter words .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3906567985/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3906567985_265ae36bdf.jpg" alt="Oracle and sun advertisement a comedy" /></a>  Its such a beautiful quotes . I hope you may have enjoyed this . If you are interested to know more do visit the oracle site http://www.oracle.com/features/suncustomers.html . Don&#8217;t know how long will it be there .</p>
