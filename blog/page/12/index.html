  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was trying to use pagination I didnot find a complete example . From different blogs and mannuals I finally figured it . So I thought of posting it for myself and for others trying to learn it .  You need to grab the result and pass to Zend_Paginator .      /<em>     * Get the page number , default 1     </em>/     $page = $this->_getParam(&#8216;page&#8217;,1);     /<em>     * Object of Zend_Paginator     </em>/     $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($result);     /<em>     * Set the number of counts in a page     </em>/     $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(2);     /<em>     * Set the current page number     </em>/     $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);     /<em>     * Assign to view     </em>/     $this->view->paginator = $paginator;  I hope you have this code in the indexAction . If its in indexAction add the below code in the index.phtml view script , else according to the view of your Action .      <h1>Example</h1>     &lt;?php if (count($this->paginator)): ?>     <ul>     &lt;?php     /<em>     * Iterate through the paginator to show the results     </em>/     foreach ($this->paginator as $item): ?>     <li>&lt;?php echo $item[&#8216;FirstName&#8217;] .&#8221; &#8220;.$item[&#8216;LastName&#8217;]; ?></li>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     </ul>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     &lt;?php     /<em>     * Print the pagination of type , drop down or search type or of your choice.     </em>/     echo $this->paginationControl($this->paginator,                                         &#8216;Sliding&#8217;,                                         &#8216;/partials/my_pagination_control.phtml&#8217;); ?>  This code is from the zend mannuals , but it didnot tell where to keep this . You need to keep this in the views folder . I am keeping it in application/views/scripts/partials/my_pagination_control.phtml . I have added the 3 types of pagination in this . You can remove or comment it and look how each type of pagination looks . The drop down is uncommented for now .      &lt;?php     /<em>     * Search pagination     </em>/     ?>     &lt;?php /<em>if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <div class="paginationControl">     <!-- Previous page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>     <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->previous)); ?>&#8221;> &lt;&lt; Previous</a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>     <span class="disabled">&lt; Previous</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Numbered page links -->     &lt;?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>     &lt;?php if ($page != $this->current): ?>         <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $page)); ?>&#8221;>             &lt;?php echo $page; ?>         </a> |       &lt;?php else: ?>         &lt;?php echo $page; ?> |       &lt;?php endif; ?>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     <!-- Next page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->next)); ?>&#8221;>         Next &gt;       </a>     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Next &gt;</span>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     </div>     &lt;?php endif; </em>/?>     &lt;?php     /<em>      </em> Item pagination example      <em>      </em>/     ?>     <!--     See http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/pattern.php?pattern=itempagination     -->     &lt;?php /<em>if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <div class="paginationControl">     &lt;?php echo $this->firstItemNumber; ?> - &lt;?php echo $this->lastItemNumber; ?>     of &lt;?php echo $this->totalItemCount; ?>     <!-- First page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->first)); ?>&#8221;>First </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">First</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Previous page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->previous)); ?>&#8221;> &lt; Previous  </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">&lt; Previous</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Next page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->next)); ?>&#8221;>  Next &gt; </a> |     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Next &gt;</span> |     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <!-- Last page link -->     &lt;?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>       <a href="<?php echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $this->last)); ?>&#8221;>  Last  </a>     &lt;?php else: ?>       <span class="disabled">Last</span>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     </div>     &lt;?php endif; </em>/?>     &lt;?php     /<em>      </em> Drop down paginaton example      */     ?>     &lt;?php if ($this->pageCount): ?>     <select id="paginationControl" size="1">     &lt;?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>       &lt;?php $selected = ($page == $this->current) ? &#8217; selected=&#8221;selected&#8221;&#8217; : &#8221;; ?>       <option value="<?php             echo $this->url(array(&#8216;page&#8217; => $page));?>&#8221;&lt;?php echo $selected ?>>         &lt;?php echo $page; ?>       </option>     &lt;?php endforeach; ?>     </select>     &lt;?php endif; ?>     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.0.2/prototype.js"></script>     <script type="text/javascript">     $('paginationControl').observe('change', function() {         window.location = this.options[this.selectedIndex].value;     })     </script>  Hope it works for you .

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://windows7sins.org/"><img src="http://windows7sins.org/i/widget.png" alt="Windows 7 Sins" /></a>Though Microsoft has not officially released the Windows 7 , their new operating system , FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) has started the site http://windows7sins.org/ . Many of you may be knowing Vista was a major failure for Microsoft , I got a chance to see the operating system from one of my friend . Its really a tough job to use it . May be because I was new to Vista and I was not using Windows XP . There are lots of changes in the Control panel itself which was really complicated to many people I think after they are coming from a Windows XP background .  As microsoft is telling their new OS will be light and users dont need to upgrade the hardware or buy new PC as Vista , we may need to see it . I don&#8217;t know how much profit will the make after the release of Windows 7 as Google itself is into the OS market with the new Google chrome which is an opensource OS running on top of Linux kernel .  If microsoft stops the Internet Explorer browser then  webdevelopers like me don&#8217;t want to work on windows from office too . As many of them are still using IE to browse the web. I do recommend Mozilla firefox for safer and faster browsing which is another opensource webbrowser which was once backed by the support of Google itself .  Guys I recommend you to use any distro of GNU/Linux . The Ubuntu one of the debain based distro may be the popular one used by many users for the cannonical was sending free CD&#8217;s to home . There are lots of opensource and GPL based softwares . Enjoy the freedom of GNU/GPL and opensource .  I am a developer so I love to see the new technology and will try to learn from it . So I am not against the company or its product but only to the properitery licence . Linus Torvalds has once told in the introduction of git in google summer of code that he don&#8217;t trust every one, and only trust a few . Like the same as I am a developer I don&#8217;t trust all but the community . So we may sometimes need to look into the code to know how it works . Am I right ?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was trying with two new addons . SkipScreen and Screengrab which is similar to FireShot but something extra .  SkipScreen is used to skip the wait time . For eg : When we try to download some files from rapid share we may need to wait for 150 seconds . This wait time will be reduced when you are using the skip screen . This will skip the wait time not only of rapid share , but for the many sites . I hope this will be  a wonderful tool for you if you are using the skipscreen addon of Mozilla firefox .  Screengrab which is similar to FireShot . But it has some more features . Both Screengrab and Fireshot is  a great tool especailly for web-developers . For eg : When we are adding a portfolio for a site we may need to grab a portion or the entire page. I have used the print screen and then the photoshop to make it. But now its simple with the help of screengrab and Fireshot . Both can take the entire page or the viewable part in the browser . But Screengrab can take a particular portion . You need just to drag the selection . It will get the screenshot for you . So no need to go and edit . But you can use photoshop or any other tool if needed .  Browse the other wonderful collection of addons from mozilla firefox and let me know what you think about the other .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was viewing Tech crunch site at techcrunch.com .  There was a post claiming about the new advertisement made by Oracle in the European edition of the Wall Street Journal . You may love to see the advertisement . We can call this as a comedy or something serious or like a warning in lighter words .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3906567985/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3906567985_265ae36bdf.jpg" alt="Oracle and sun advertisement a comedy" /></a>  Its such a beautiful quotes . I hope you may have enjoyed this . If you are interested to know more do visit the oracle site http://www.oracle.com/features/suncustomers.html . Don&#8217;t know how long will it be there .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Testing is really pain . How do you figure that all the code you write is fully functional ? For eg : 5 divided by 0 will give you a Math error . So you may need to test our codes . Phpunit is a tool to test your codes . Recently I was trying to learn to write test cases as I started learning Zend framework . There are many automated testing tools like phpunit . You can explore it if needed .  Another one is the phpundercontrol ( I was hearing about this in many blogs and php magazines )  . It can be installed with phpunit . Its also a great tool to see the graphical representation of the php performance . I have not looked much, so do visit the sites and get more informations about it .  http://www.phpunit.de  http://phpundercontrol.org  http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3858966507_9aef76db9d.jpg" alt="image" />Learning Zend framework made me explore many new tools . The selenium IDE which is an add on for Mozilla is a wonderful tool for testers . For eg : we are humans and we may forget the actions done what all things we do . But we can record our clicks and inputs using selenium IDE . So when an error occurs we can show the developer what happens and what was the input entered etc .  I am really excited to see the Selenium IDE . I hope you testers and developers too will love this wonderful addon . Currently Selenium is supported by the browsers given below .  I have taken the list from the site . So if you are interested please do visit the site and get more information .  Browser Selenium IDE Selenium Remote Control Selenium Core Firefox 3 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests Firefox 2 Record and playback tests Start browser, run tests Run tests IE 8b1 not supported ? ? IE 7 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 3 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Safari 2 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 9 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Opera 8 not supported Start browser, run tests Run tests Others not supported Partial support possible* Run tests**</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was hearing about Bhuvan recently . I was little busy , but after receiving a mail with subject &#8220;Bhuvan: ISRO&#8217;s answer to google earth&#8221; I thought of looking the site .  This is the address . http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/ . I saw new news Bhuvan is available in Mozilla firefox and netscape .  Bhuvan is only for the geographical area of India only . But I don&#8217;t think whether it will gain much popularity if they have not supported or developed a plugin for GNU/Linux or in common *nix systems . I think many of the Indians are now opensource lovers and have moved to *nix platform . So the ISRO which is a goverment body must really support the opensource projects rather than developing something for properitery OS. Now the web is a platform which makes the OS independent . So try to make something which is not an OS dependent software .  I hope they may come with a plugin for *nix systems . I would like to explore Bhuvan after that , and now its not an answer for Google earth . Google earth can be viewed from *nix systems .  This is for ISRO people <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , track your site vistors Operating system and Browser and compare . You can see the difference . Google analytics is a good one or you can go for piwik an opensource web analytics tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning Zendframework . When you are working on some frameworks you need a good IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) . There are many IDE&#8217;s that are opensource and properitery . I was using Aptana once and then jumped to Eclipse . Recently I got a Zendstudio i5 licence . I was very Happy to see the Zendstudio licence.  If they have not given me a licence I may not be able to buy one too . I don&#8217;t earn that much money a month lol .  I have loved to buy many videos and studio . But I was unable as I don&#8217;t have as much penny in my pocket. Anyway I got the Zendstudio-i5 which is a Perpetual license . So I am trying the IDE and will let you know how it looks and what are the things new in it .  Keeping a screenshot of the zendstudio i5 .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2597/3847184227_2dfa1c6eaa.jpg" alt="Zendstudio i5 to make easy development of Zendframework projects" />  Bye and Thanks Zend once again for giving me one copy .</p>
